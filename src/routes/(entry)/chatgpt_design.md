# Here is an example of a design for a home page for a productivity web app

1. The header at the top of the page should contain the name of the app, a logo, and navigation links to other pages such as a "Features" page and a "Pricing" page.

2. The main section of the page should contain a large hero image or video that showcases the app's key features and benefits. This could be accompanied by a tagline or short description of the app's purpose.

3. Below the hero image, you can include a section with testimonials from satisfied users. This could include quotes and headshots of the users, as well as logos of any companies they represent.

4. The next section could contain a list of the app's key features, each accompanied by an icon or screenshot to help visualize the feature. You can also include a call-to-action button, such as "Sign Up" or "Try it Free," to encourage users to start using the app.

5. The footer at the bottom of the page should include links to your company's social media profiles, a contact form, and a privacy policy. You can also include a newsletter sign-up form to encourage users to stay up to date with the latest updates from your company.

By following these design guidelines, you can create a home page for a productivity web app that effectively showcases the app's key features and benefits to potential users.
